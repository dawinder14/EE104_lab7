CNN Baseline
	It was extremely difficult changing the base code as every change resulted in some sort of error.
	From the graph between the val_accuracy and training accuracy, we can see that our data is
	overshooting as the training accuracy is higher. To solve this, if more time was was available,
	some layers can be deleted or edited accordingly. Better data augmentation can most likely improve
	accuracy as well.
